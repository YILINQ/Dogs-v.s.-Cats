# Dogs-v.s.-Cats
This is a fun project that uses kaggle dataset to detect and classify different kinds of dogs and cats.
# Folders
* folder VGG16_testcode includes the code we used when we want to construct the CNN model through training the datasets. We train the dog and cat datasets separately and plot the accuracy and loss rate after we trained the model.
* folder dog_pos and cat_pos include the positive training images for SVM
* folder dog_neg and cat_neg include the negative training images for SVM
* folder dog_cat_data includes training and testing images for CNN
